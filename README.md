**ENG MohameNageeb**

## Overview
This project demonstrates the deployment and management of a highly available AWS infrastructure using Terraform. It includes:

- Multiâ€“Availability Zone VPC setup
- EC2 Auto Scaling Groups
- Load Balancers for traffic distribution
- Secure networking (subnets, security groups)
- Jenkins CI/CD server deployment
- Integration with Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring

## Features
- Automated build and deployment pipelines with Jenkins
- Real-time monitoring and dashboards with Prometheus & Grafana
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform for reproducibility
- High availability and fault tolerance across multiple AZs
